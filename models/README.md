The following meshes with ground truth skeletons and weights are new to our work:

* `cylinder`
* `cube`
* `cheburashka`
* `wolf`
* `cow`


The following meshes were downloaded from
[Mesh Data from Deformation Transfer for Triangle Meshes [Sumner and Popovic 2004]](http://people.csail.mit.edu/sumner/research/deftransfer/data.html)
and rescaled:

* `horse-collapse`
* `horse-gallop` (duplicated also as `horse`)
* `horse-poses`
* `cat-poses`
* `lion-poses`
* `face-poses`
* `elephant-gallop` (duplicated also as `elephant`)
* `elephant-poses`


The following meshes were downloaded from
[Articulated Mesh Animation from Multi-view Silhouettes [Vlasic et al. 2008]](http://people.csail.mit.edu/drdaniel/mesh_animation/):

* `crane`
* `samba`


`chickenCrossing` was obtained from [here](http://graphics.cs.cmu.edu/projects/sma/textData/). It comes with the following notice:

> The chicken character was created by Andrew Glassner, Tom McClure, Scott Benza, and Mark Van Langeveld. This short sequence of connectivity and vertex position data is distributed solely for the purpose of comparison of geometry compression techniques.


The following meshes were downloaded from [Geometry Videos: A new representation for 3D animations [Brice√±o et al. 2003]](https://web.archive.org/web/20061119211335/http://www710.univ-lyon1.fr/~hbriceno/research/geometryvideos/):

* `elasticCow` is from `cowheavy.tar.gz`
* `pcow` is the same as `elasticCow`
* `pdance` is from `dance.tar.gz`

`pjump`'s origin is lost to us.
